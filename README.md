# Call Centre Report 2024 (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using MS Excel)

This project is an interactive Call Centre Performance Dashboard designed to visualize key call center metrics, analyze call trends, and provide insights into customer interactions. This dashboard helps businesses track performance, improve customer experience, and optimize operations.


## Learning Experience

I built this dashboard as part of my learning journey in interactive data visualization, where I enhanced my skills in Excel, Power Query, data analysis, and storytelling. This project allowed me to practice real-world data analytics and design a user-friendly dashboard that provides actionable insights.
## Features and Insights

The dashboard includes multiple visualizations and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure call center efficiency.

## 1. Key Matrics(KPIs)
   **Total Calls:** 1000 <br>
    **Total Revenue Generated**: $96,623<br>
    **Total Call Duration**: 89,850 minutes<br>
    **Average Customer Rating**: 3.9/5<br>
    **Happy Callers**: 360 Customer<br>
## 2. Call Trend Analysis
  Line and area chart tracking **call volume trends**  over different months.<br>
 Helps identify peak and low call periods to optimize staffing and resources.
## 3. Call Distribution Day by Day
Displays the number of calls handled on each day of the week.<br>
Useful for understanding which days have the highest or lowest customer engagement.
## 4. Gender-wise Call Analysis
   **Female vs Male Callers** segmented across different cities **(Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus)**.<br>
Helps in analyzing customer demographics and trends.
## 5. Rating Distribution
Each representative's performance in terms of calls handled and revenue generated.<br>
Helps management identify top-performing agents and areas for training.
